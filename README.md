# MamaCare
MamaCare is a USSD/SMS-based maternal health solution that helps rural Nigerian women access care through appointment reminders, health tips, and emergency contacts in local languages. I analyzed user data and designed a low-tech, multilingual system to improve maternal health access using basic mobile phones.

##  Project Overview

MamaCare is a USSD and SMS-based maternal health solution designed to support rural Nigerian women who primarily use basic (non-smart) mobile phones. The platform reduces missed antenatal and postnatal appointments by delivering timely reminders, localized health tips, and emergency contact options — all without requiring internet access.



## The Problem

Nigeria faces one of the highest maternal mortality rates globally, with an estimated 512 deaths per 100,000 live births (WHO, 2020). Key contributing factors include:

- 60% of rural women miss at least one antenatal visit (NDHS 2018).
- Only 28% use smartphones; 89% rely on feature phones.
- Language barriers, poor communication, and lack of follow-up reduce care adherence.

Our user research highlighted that women like Zainab (25, Bauchi) forget appointments and prefer health info in local languages like Hausa.



##  My Contributions

- Analyzed national and user-level data (NDHS) to validate gaps in maternal health access.
- Used Python to uncover trends in appointment adherence and optimize messaging strategies.
- Shaped user personas and co-designed user flows to minimize steps and improve clarity.
- Created bar and pie chart visualizations to support decision-making and stakeholder engagement.



## The Solution

MamaCare’s USSD prototype features:

- Language selection (Hausa, English, Yoruba, Igbo)
- Antenatal appointment reminders with confirmation
- Weekly health tips in local languages
- Postnatal care and immunization alerts
- Emergency contact access
- Offline access on any mobile device



## User Testing & Iteration

Key insights and improvements:
- Too many steps → shortened USSD flows for ease of use.
- Language preference → Hausa set as default in northern states.
- Navigation issues → added "Back to Main Menu" and confirmation prompts.



##  Impact & Next Steps

MamaCare empowers under-served women with low-tech access to life-saving maternal care.

- Increases antenatal/postnatal appointment adherence
- Reduces language and literacy barriers
- Delivers reliable care support on any mobile phone

Next Steps:
- Pilot launch in 2 rural Local Government Areas (LGAs)
- Partner with health centers and NGOs
- Expand to support nutrition alerts and referral systems
