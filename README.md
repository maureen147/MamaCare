# MamaCare
MamaCare is a USSD/SMS-based maternal health solution that helps rural Nigerian women access care through appointment reminders, health tips, and emergency contacts in local languages. I analyzed user data and designed a low-tech, multilingual system to improve maternal health access using basic mobile phones.
